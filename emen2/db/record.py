class Record(emen2.db.dataobject.PermissionsDBObject):
    """Database Record.

    Provides the following additional attributes:
        rectype, history, comments

    This class represents a single database record. In a sense this is an
    instance of a particular RecordDef, however, note that it is not required
    to have a value for every field described in the RecordDef, although this
    will usually be the case. This class is a subclass of PermissionsDBObject
    (and BaseDBObject); see these classes for additinal documentation.

    The RecordDef name is stored in the rectype attribute. Currently, this
    cannot be changed after a Record is created, even by admins. However, this
    functionality may be provided at some point in the future.

    Unlike most other DBOs, Records allow arbitrary attributes
    as long as they are valid EMEN2 Parameters. These are stored in the params
    attribute, which is a dictionary with parameter names as keys.  The params
    attribute is effectively private and not exported. Instead, it is part of
    the mapping interface. Items can be set with __setitem__
    (record['parameter'] = Value) or through an update(). When an item is
    exported (e.g. JSON), the contents of param are in the regular dictionary
    of attributes. Changes to these parameters are always logged in the history
    log, described below, and will always trigger an update to the
    modification time.

    Records contain an integrated log of all changes over the entire history
    of the record. In a sense, as in a physical lab notebook, an original value
    can never be changed, only superceded. This log is stored in the history
    attribute, which is a list containing a tuple entry for every change made,
    in the following format:

    0
        User
    1
        Time of change
    2
        Parameter changed
    3
        Previous parameter value

    The history log is immutable, even to admins, and is updated when the item
    is committed. From a database standpoint, this is rather odd behavior. Such
    tasks would generally be handled with an audit log of some sort. However,
    in this case, as an electronic representation of a Scientific lab notebook,
    it is absolutely necessary that all historical values are permanently
    preserved for any field, and there is no particular reason to store this
    information in a separate file. Generally speaking, such changes should be
    infrequent. When a value is edited, the user interface should generally
    prompt the user for a comment describing the reason for the change. If
    provided, the comment and the history log item will have the same timestamp.

    Users also can store free-form textual comments in the comments attribute,
    either by setting the comments key (item['comments'] = 'Test') or through
    the  addcomment() method. Comments will stored as plain text, and usually
    displayed with Markdown-type formatting applied. Like the history log,
    comments are immutable once set, even to admins. Additionally, parameters
    can be updated inside of a comment using the RecordDef view syntax:
        $$parameter="value"

    Each new comment is added to the comments list as a tuple with the format:

    0
        User
    1
        Time of comment
    2
        Comment text


    The following methods are overridden:

    init
                Init the rectype, comments, and history
    keys
